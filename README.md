### 2. Enable GitHub Actions

The workflow runs automatically every Monday at 10 AM UTC. You can also trigger it manually from the Actions tab.

For extra reliability, set up a webhook trigger using cron-job.org:

1. Go to [cron-job.org](https://cron-job.org)
2. Create a new cron job
3. Set URL: `https://api.github.com/repos/YOUR_USERNAME/techno_agent/dispatches`
4. Method: POST
5. Headers:
   ```
   Authorization: token YOUR_GITHUB_TOKEN
   Accept: application/vnd.github.v3+json
   Content-Type: application/json
   ```
6. Body:
   ```json
   {"event_type": "scrape-events"}
   ```

## Local Development

```bash
# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Run scraper (JSON output)
python main.py

# Run with email
python main.py --email your@email.com --output email

# Look ahead 14 days
python main.py --days 14
```

## Testing

```bash
# Run all tests
pytest

# Run with coverage report
pytest --cov=. --cov-report=term-missing

# Run specific test file
pytest tests/test_models.py

# Run tests in watch mode
pytest-watch
```

The project includes comprehensive test coverage for:
- Event model and deduplication logic
- Base scraper functionality
- Individual venue scrapers
- Date parsing (including Dutch formats)
- Email formatting and sending
- Main orchestrator integration

## Adding New Venues

1. Create a new scraper in `scrapers/` inheriting from `BaseScraper`
2. Implement the `scrape_events()` method
3. Add the scraper to `main.py`

- **Radion** - Multi-space arts and music venue  
- **Lofi** - Industrial venue with multiple dancefloors

## Future Enhancements

- More venues (Garage Noord, Doka, Sexyland)
